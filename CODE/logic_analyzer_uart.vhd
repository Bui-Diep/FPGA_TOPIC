-- This logic analyzer generates a UART serial output at a baud rate of 115200 baud, which can be connected to a PC and viewed using software such as PulseView. The input channels are sampled on each clock cycle and the current values are stored in a register. A counter and divider are used to generate the UART serial output at the desired baud rate. The serial output consists of the values of the input channels, one value per clock cycle.
